    <h3>About</h3>
    <div class="bg">
    <p style="color: black; ">Nutritional management systems are software applications that are designed to help individuals and healthcare professionals track and manage a person's dietary intake. These systems can be used to monitor nutrient intake, set and track goals, and provide personalized recommendations for maintaining a healthy diet.

        One of the key technologies used in the development of nutritional management systems is the combination of CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. These technologies allow for the creation of a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, as well as the ability to perform complex calculations and data analysis.
        
        One of the main features of a nutritional management system built using CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS is the use of nutritional tags. These tags are used to identify specific vitamins and minerals present in a recipe, making it easy for users to search for and find meals that meet their specific dietary needs. This feature can be particularly useful for individuals with dietary restrictions or who are trying to increase their intake of certain nutrients.
        
        Another important feature of a nutritional management system is the ability to generate weekly and monthly fitness reports. These reports provide users with a detailed analysis of their dietary intake over a specific period of time, highlighting any areas where they may be falling short of their goals or exceeding their recommended intake of certain nutrients. This information can be used to make adjustments to their diet and track progress towards their health goals.
        
        A health state display is also a key feature of a nutritional management system. This display shows the vitamins and minerals that an individual is taking in excess or deficit. This helps the user to be aware of the deficiencies and excesses in their diet and make necessary adjustments. This feature is particularly useful for individuals with certain health conditions or who are taking medication that may interact with certain nutrients.
        
        Overall, a nutritional management system built using CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS is a powerful tool for individuals and healthcare professionals to monitor and manage dietary intake. The use of nutritional tags, weekly and monthly fitness reports, and a health state display allows for a more personalized and effective approach to maintaining a healthy diet</p>
